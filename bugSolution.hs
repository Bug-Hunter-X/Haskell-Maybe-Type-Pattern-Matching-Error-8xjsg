The solution involves adding a `Nothing` case to the pattern match to handle the scenario where the `Maybe` value is empty. 
```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
myFunction Nothing = 0 -- Handle the Nothing case
```
This revised function will now correctly return 0 when the input is `Nothing`, preventing the runtime error.
