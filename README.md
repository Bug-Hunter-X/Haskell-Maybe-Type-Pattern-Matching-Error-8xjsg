This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: forgetting to handle the `Nothing` case when pattern matching on a `Maybe` type.  The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which will throw a runtime exception if the input is `Nothing`. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides the corrected code, showing how to properly handle the `Nothing` case to prevent the error.
